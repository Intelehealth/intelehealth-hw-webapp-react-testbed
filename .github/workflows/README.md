## üèóÔ∏è Deployment Environments

### Development (`dev` branch)

- **Purpose**: Development testing
- **Deployment**: Automatic on push
- **Features**: Basic quality checks, dev build

### QA (`qa` branch)

- **Purpose**: Quality assurance testing
- **Deployment**: Automatic on push
- **Features**: Full quality checks, E2E tests, monitoring

### Staging (`staging` branch)

- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing
- **Deployment**: Automatic on push
- **Features**: Production-level checks, smoke tests

### Production (`main` branch)

## üìä Monitoring & Notifications

### Coverage Reporting

- **Codecov**: Automatic coverage reporting for all workflows
- **Multi-Node Testing**: Coverage tracked for Node 18 & 20
- **Reports**: Available in PR comments and artifacts
- **Upload**: Automatic upload on every test run

### Security Monitoring

- **PR Checks**: Moderate-level security audits on every PR
- **Code Quality**: High-level security audits on pushes + weekly schedule
- **Dependency Audit**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanning
- **Secret Scanning**: Prevents secret commits in source code
- **Environment Checks**: Validates environment variable usage

### Quality Metrics

- **Bundle Size**: Monitored and reported with performance budget checks
- **Performance**: Bundle analysis and size tracking

- **Test Coverage**: Multi-version testing with detailed coverage reports
- **Artifacts**: Build files and quality reports stored for 7-30 days

## üö® Failure Handling

### Test Failures

- **Action**: Block deployment
- **Notification**: PR comments, team notifications
- **Resolution**: Fix issues and re-run

### Security Issues

- **Action**: Block deployment for high/critical issues
- **Notification**: Security team alerts
- **Resolution**: Update dependencies, fix vulnerabilities

### Build Failures

- **Action**: Block deployment
- **Notification**: Developer notifications
- **Resolution**: Fix build issues and re-run

## üìù Customization

### Adding New Environments

1. Create new workflow file (e.g., `deploy-custom.yml`)
2. Add environment-specific secrets
3. Configure deployment steps
4. Add to branch triggers

### Modifying Quality Checks

1. Update workflow files
2. Add new check steps
3. Configure failure conditions
4. Update notifications

### Adding Notifications

1. Configure notification services (Slack, email, etc.)
2. Add notification steps to workflows
3. Set up environment-specific notifications

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Node.js version conflicts**: Check matrix strategy
- **Cache issues**: Clear GitHub Actions cache
- **Secret not found**: Verify secret names and permissions
- **Build failures**: Check environment variables

### Debug Steps

1. Check workflow logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test locally with same Node.js version
4. Check dependency versions
